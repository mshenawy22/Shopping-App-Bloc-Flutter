# flutter_shopping_cart

This repository is based on Felix Angelov's shopping cart example in the official Flutter Bloc repository. The goal of this project is to build upon the existing shopping cart app and implement additional features to understand and utilize the Bloc architecture in a more realistic setting.

For a detailed step-by-step tutorial, please follow my Medium article: [Flutter Bloc Shopping Cart App - Part 1](https://medium.com/@mohamed.shenawy92/flutter-bloc-shopping-cart-app-part-1-436eeb56e57f)

## Features

In this repository, we will be implementing the following features:

1. **Adding Quantity:** Enhance the shopping items by allowing users to select a quantity for each item they wish to purchase.

2. **Modifying Bloc Logic:** Improve the Bloc logic to handle the updated quantity of each item in the shopping cart.

3. **UI Enhancements:** Modify the user interface to include buttons for adding and removing items, as well as displaying the selected items with their respective quantities.
